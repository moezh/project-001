        If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to
        respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations
        of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of
        others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any
        applicable law, rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging
        information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk
        reduction.
      </p>

      <h3>Third-Party Advertisers</h3>

        in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest
        to you.
      </p>

        Application and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your
        geographic area or demographic information. When you click on an offer

      <h3>Sale or Bankruptcy</h3>
      <p>
        If we reorganize or sell all or a portion of our assets, undergo a
        merger, or are acquired by another entity, we may transfer your

        bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired
        by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that

        We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking
        technologies on the Application to help customize the Application and
        improve your experience. When you access the Application, your personal
        information is not collected through the use of tracking technology.
        Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can remove or
        reject cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the
        availability and functionality of the Application. You may not decline
        web beacons. However, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all
        cookies or by modifying your web browser's settings to notify you each
        time a cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline cookies
        on an individual basis.
      </p>
      <h3>Internet-Based Advertising</h3>
      <p>
        Additionally, we may use third-party software to serve ads on the
        Application, implement email marketing campaigns, and manage other
        interactive marketing initiatives. This third-party software may use

      </p>
      <h3>Website Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        We may also partner with selected third-party vendors to allow tracking
        technologies and remarketing services on the Application through the use
        of first party cookies and third-party cookies, to, among other things,
        analyze and track users' use of the Application, determine the
        popularity of certain content, and better understand online activity. By
        accessing the Application, you consent to the collection and use of your
        information by these third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review
        their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your
        questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party
        vendors.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be aware that getting a new computer, installing a new
        browser, upgrading an existing browser, or erasing or otherwise altering
        your browser's cookies files may also clear certain opt-out cookies,
        plug-ins, or settings.
      </p>
      <h2>Third-party websites</h2>
      <p>
        The Application may contain links to third-party websites and
        applications of interest, including advertisements and external
        services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these
        links to leave the Application, any information you provide to these
        third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot
        guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. Before visiting
        and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should
        inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the
        third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps
        necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your
        information. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and
        security practices and policies of any third parties, including other
        sites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the
        Application.
      </p>
      <h2>Security of your information</h2>
      <p>
        We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help
        protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps
        to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware
        that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or
        impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed
        against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information
        disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by
        unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security
        if you provide personal information.
      </p>
      <h2>Policy for children</h2>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under
        the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from
        children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information
        provided below.
      </p>
      <h2>Controls for do-not-track features</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a
        Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your
        privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
        activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
        recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we
        do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
        that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
        a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
        future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
        this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h2>Options regarding your information</h2>

      </p>
